ecosym
======

Ecosystem simulator inspired by *A Primer of Ecology* by Nicholas J. Gotelli.  Ecosym runs basic ecosystem models, e.g. population dynamics under exponential or logistic growth, and plots population over time.  Multiple models can be active at once, and you can tweak the model parameters to see how they affect things.
